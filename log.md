## 2026-09-10 — Wiki created

Set up the LLM wiki following Karpathy's pattern: raw `sources/`, generated
`wiki/`, schema in `CLAUDE.md`.

- Scaffolded the skill tree with 15 skill areas across four bands
  (fundamentals, building, designing, getting hired), all `unseen`.
- Wrote the status ladder: nothing gets promoted without a link to evidence.
- Seeded [[wiki/concepts/two-pointers]] as the worked example of a concept page.

**Open:** [[wiki/meta/profile]] is a stub — target role and timeline unset, so
[[wiki/meta/gaps]] can't be ranked yet and `plan` will be generic until it is.

**Next:** fill in the profile, then `plan`.

## 2026-09-10 — Focus set: DSA / Blind 75, Lesson 1 ready

Narrowed the vault to a single track. Everything outside Band 1 is parked.

- Added the curriculum spine: [[wiki/curriculum/index]] (18 topics, 75 problems;
  topic groups and counts confirmed against the live NeetCode list) and
  [[wiki/curriculum/arrays-hashing]] indexed down to all 8 problems.
- Replaced the `drill` operation with the three-step loop Rob asked for:
  `lesson` → `timed` (30-min box, no hints) → `debrief`. Rules in `CLAUDE.md`.
  Unfinished problems requeue at +2 days rather than being written off.
- Wrote [[wiki/lessons/01-arrays-hashing]]: mental model, hashing mechanics,
  complexity table, the six pattern triggers (A–F), Python traps, and a worked
  example chosen from *outside* the problem set so nothing is spoiled.
- Added [[wiki/meta/resources]] — GfG and LeetCode links, all reachability-checked.
  Dropped one dead GfG URL (`hashing-set-1-introduction`, 404).
- Seeded concepts: [[wiki/concepts/hash-map]], [[wiki/concepts/frequency-map]],
  [[wiki/concepts/complement-lookup]].
- [[wiki/meta/gaps]] re-ranked around DSA; profile stub demoted to Background
  since it no longer blocks.

**Next:** read Lesson 1, then `timed contains-duplicate`.
